## About me
My primary goal is become a fullstack developer. I started this path from studying for a front-end developer. 
I love to overcome difficulties and improve myself from day to day. I consider my positive qualities: perseverance, striving for new knowledge, pedantry in work and a constant search for solutions to work problems, even in my free time.
